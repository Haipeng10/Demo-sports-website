<h2 class="display-2">Athletics Overview</h2>
<p class="fs-5">Brandeis fields 19 Division III varsity athletic programs. The Judges compete in the University Athletic
    Association (UAA), comprising Carnegie Mellon University, Case Western Reserve University, Emory University, New
    York University, the University of Chicago, the University of Rochester and Washington University (St. Louis).
    UAA teams are among the most successful athletic programs in the nation, giving Brandeis athletes a chance to
    prove themselves against the best Division III has to offer.

    Through participation in varsity athletics at Brandeis, student-athletes should develop skills to work
    effectively as part of a team, improve individual skills and overall performance, learn to communicate
    effectively with diverse populations, develop leadership skills, and demonstrate and understand sportsmanship
    and fairness.

    Over the years, Brandeis has won NCAA team championships in men's soccer (1976) and men's cross country (1983),
    as well as 27 individual titles. Since 2011, Brandeis has produced 67 All-Americans. In 2021-22, Erin Magill
    '22, earned three All-America honors in cross country and track and field, while Tony Escueta '25 and Maggie
    Shealy '23 were named the national Division III Sabre Fencers of the Year in 2022. Brandeis teams have claimed
    19 NCAA Tournament berths and had seven different programs earn national rankings, including five during the
    2021-22 season. Three teams have made NCAA Final Four appearances in that span and one other reach the Elite
    Eight. Three Brandeis coaches have been named National Coach of the Year and six have earned UAA Coaching Staff
    of the Year honors.

    Among Brandeis's top student-athlete alumni are Nelson Figueroa '98, the program's first major league baseball
    player, who played for nine years in Major League Baseball and pitched for runner-up Puerto Rico in the 2013
    World Baseball Classic, and three-time Olympic fencer Tim Morehouse '00, the University's first Olympic
    qualifier in Athens in 2004 and first medalist, winning a team silver in the saber in Beijing in 2008. The
    Judges' have also boasted legendary coaches from Bud Collins of the tennis team to former Boston Celtics K.C.
    Jones, Bob Brannum and Chris Ford with the basketball team. </p>
